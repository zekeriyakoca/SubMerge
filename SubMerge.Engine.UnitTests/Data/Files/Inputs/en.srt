And I'm just gonna lose it.
I mean, I am gonna lose it, Joyce.

182
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,910
Just take it down, Hopper.

183
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,494
I need for them to break up.

184
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,163
That is not your decision.

185
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,708
They're spending entirely too much
time together.

186
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,002
You agree with me about that, right?

187
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,963
Well, I mean, they're just kissing, right?

188
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,758
Yeah, but it is constant.

189
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,135
It is constant.

190
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,013
Okay? That is not normal,

191
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,640
that is not healthy.

192
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,351
You can't just force them apart.

193
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,645
I mean,
they're not little kids anymore, Hop.

194
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,896
They're teenagers.

195
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,482
If you order them around like a cop,
then they're gonna rebel.

196
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,900
It's just what they do.

197
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,486
So what, I'm just supposed to
let them do whatever they want?

198
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,656
No, I didn't say that.
I think you should... talk to them.

199
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,075
No. No. 'Cause talking doesn't work.

200
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,744
Not yelling. Not ordering.

201
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,454
But talk to them.

202
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,957
You know, like a heart-to-heart.

203
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,960
A heart-to-heart?

204
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,711
What is that?

205
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,382
You sit them down and you talk to them,
like you're their friend.

206
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,218
I find if you talk to them
like you're on their level,

207
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,803
then they really start to listen.

208
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,347
And then, you know,
you could start to create some boundaries.

209
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,891
- Boundaries.
- Yeah, but,

210
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,812
Hop, it's really important
that no matter how they respond,

211
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,063
you stay calm.

212
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,399
You cannot lose your temper.

213
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,442
Uh...

214
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,861
Maybe you could do it for me?

215
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,113
No.

216
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,516
Yeah, you could. Yeah, you could.
You come over after work.

217
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,033
- Yes.
- No.

218
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,703
It only works if it comes from you.

219
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,454
But...

220
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,042
- But?
- Maybe I can help you...

221
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,670
find the right words.

222
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,723
♪ <i>Ooh, whoa! ♪</i>

223
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,143
<i>♪ Some days won't end ever
And some days pass on by ♪</i>

224
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,894
<i>♪ I'll be workin' here forever... ♪</i>

225
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,563
- Thanks, hon.
- For you.

226
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,981
For you.

227
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,900
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

228
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,196
Oh, no, no, no, no! Nancy!

229
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,032
Sorry.

230
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,122
- How 'bout a piece on Iran?
- I want something local.

231
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,583
I hear there's a beauty pageant
at the fair this year.

232
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,210
Yeah, I'm looking for above the fold here,
Bruce.

233
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,171
Then clearly you haven't seen
Lucy Lebrock,

234
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,590
because I'm not sure she'll fit
above the fold!

235
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,884
Fellas!

236
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,219
In six hours, we go to print.
I need something real.

237
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,637
Oh, I think they're real.

238
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,808
What about Starcourt?

239
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,022
I... I was just...

240
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,105
thinking...

241
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,859
I mean, I know everyone
loves the mall, but...

242
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,362
how many small businesses have closed
since it opened?

243
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,490
Like, five on Main, at least.

244
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,658
It's changing the fabric of our town

245
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,912
- in a way...
- "The Death of Small-Town America."

246
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:52,913
I like it.

247
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,289
I like it a lot.

248
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,501
But I think I've got something
even spicier.

249
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,880
It's about the missing mustard
on my hamburger.

250
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,593
You think you can follow the clues

251
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,429
and solve the case
of the missing condiment, Nancy Drew?

252
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,931
Sorry.

253
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,604
Look out, Phil,
she might be after your job!

254
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,065
Ow, ow, ow. Ow.

255
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,441
Better?

256
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,902
Still stings.

257
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,656
Is that a new zit?

258
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,034
What is wrong with you?

259
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,994
I was just asking!

260
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,330
I call it... the Forever Clock.

261
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,334
All right? Powered by wind.
Very useful in the apocalypse.

262
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,004
Then, I give you...

263
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,589
the Slammer.

264
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,928
Pretty neat, huh?

265
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,096
But this...

266
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,390
this is my masterpiece.

267
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,437
I would like you to meet...

268
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,312
Cerebro.

269
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,067
What exactly are we looking at here?

270
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,737
An unassembled one-of-a-kind
battery-powered radio tower.

271
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,867
So, it's a... a ham radio.

272
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,369
The Cadillac of ham radios.

273
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,455
This baby carries
a crystal-clear connection

274
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,538
over vast distances.

275
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,583
I'm talking North Pole to South.

276
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,462
I can talk to my girlfriend
whenever and wherever I choose.

277
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,379
Girlfriend?

278
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,258
<i>Wait, so her name is Suzie?</i>

279
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,260
Suzie with a "z." She's from Utah.

280
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,623
Girls go to science camp?

281
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,972
- Suzie does. She's a genius.
- Is she cute?

282
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,183
Think Phoebe Cates, only hotter.

283
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,685
- What's going on?
- Going to talk to Dustin's girlfriend.

284
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,145
Girlfriend?

285
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,735
Alrighty, one scoop of chocolate.
That's a buck-twenty-five.

286
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Anything else?

287
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,156
Ooh, Purdue.

288
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,366
- Fancy.
- Yeah, I'm excited.

289
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,454
Yeah, you know, I considered it,

290
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,706
Purdue, but then I was like,
you know what?

291
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,792
I really think I need some real-life
experience, you know,

292
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,170
before I hit college,
see what it feels like.

293
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,671
Kinda like, uh, I don't know,

294
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,341
see what it's like to earn
a working-man's wage, you know? Uh...

295
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,884
Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,386
- I think that's, like, really important.
- Yeah, totally.

297
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,180
Yeah, anyway, this was, like, so fun.

298
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,140
We should kind of like, you know,
I don't know,

299
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,544
maybe hang out this weekend or...

300
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,369
Oh, sorry about that. Uh...

301
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,145
I don't know. Maybe next weekend or...

302
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,980
Yeah, I'm busy.

303
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,315
Oh, that's cool. I'm...

304
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,108
I'm working here next weekend, so...

305
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,444
the following weekend's better for me.

306
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,488
No. I'm sorry, I can't.

307
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,782
Okay. Thanks.

308
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,075
I...

309
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,494
This is... my first day here.

310
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,040
And another one bites the dust.

311
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,544
You are oh-for-six, Popeye.

312
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,128
Yeah, yeah, I can count.

313
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,005
You know that means you suck.

314
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,549
Yep, I can read, too.

315
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,800
Since when?

316
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,426
It's this stupid hat.

317
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,054
I am telling you,
it is totally blowing my best feature.

318
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,557
Yeah, company policy is a real drag.

319
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,436
You know, it's a crazy idea,
but have you considered...

320
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,021
telling the truth?

321
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,107
Oh, you mean,
that I couldn't even get into Tech

322
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,442
and my douchebag dad's
trying to teach me a lesson,

323
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,279
I make three bucks an hour,
and I have no future? That truth?

324
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,656
Hey, twelve o'clock.

325
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,368
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Okay... Uh...

326
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,744
I'm going in. Okay?

327
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,830
And you know what?

328
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,542
- Screw company policy.
- Oh, my God, you're a whole new man.

329
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,002
Right? Ooh.

330
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,212
Ahoy, ladies! Didn't see you there.

331
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,132
Would you guys like to set sail
on this ocean of flavor with me?

332
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,383
I'll be your captain.

333
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,884
I'm Steve Harrington.

334
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,177
Oh, God.

335
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,542
Can I get you guys a little taste
of the Cherries Jubilee?

336
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,056
No? Anybody?

337
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,601
Banana Boat? Four people, four spoons?

338
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,145
Share it in the booth?
Anybody? It's hot out there.

339
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,231
I know this is
a difficult conversation to have...

340
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,319
but I hope you know that I...
care about you very much.

341
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,779
- And I know that you...
- Eye contact.

342
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,285
And I know that you...

343
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,163
both care about each other very much.

344
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,646
This does not sound like me at all.

345
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,583
Just keep going. Come on.

346
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,839
Which is why I think it's important
to establish these boundaries...

347
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,759
moving forward...

348
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,595
No looking. You know this.

349
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,838
Come on.

350
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,515
...so we can build an environment...

351
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,933
uh...

352
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,060
where we...

353
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,020
all feel comfortable

354
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,230
and trusted

355
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,107
and open...

356
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,611

Does she have cancer?

537
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,835
- No.
- Then I don't understand.

538
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,336
What's wrong with Nana?

539
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,465
Nothing! There's nothing wrong with Nana!

540
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,384
- What?
- But...

541
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:33,681
there's something very wrong
with this thing between you and El.

542
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,810
Oh, you lying piece of shit!

543
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,859
You're crazy!

544
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,026
Crazy?

545
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,697
You want to see real crazy?

546
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,533
You disrespect me again.

547
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,535
Okay?

548
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,707
Here's what's gonna happen.

549
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,626
I'm gonna drive you home.

550
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,047
And I'm gonna speak...

551
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,510
and you're going to listen.

552
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,555
And then, maybe...

553
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,976
maybe by the end of it,
maybe if you're lucky, maybe...

554
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,687
I will continue

555
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:27,651
to allow you to date my daughter.

556
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,576
Nod if you understand!

557
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,333
...do you copy? This is Dustin. Over.

558
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,840
Suzie! This is Dustin. Do you copy? Over.

559
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:56,055
Suzie, this is your Dustin.
Do you copy? Over.

560
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,226
- Suzie...
- Dustin, come on! She's not there.

561
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,869
She's there, all right? She'll pick up.

562
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,564
- Maybe Cerebro doesn't work.
- Or maybe Suzie doesn't exist.

563
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,565
She exists!

564
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,984
She's a genius
<i>and </i>she's hotter than Phoebe Cates?

565
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,362
No girl is that perfect.

566
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,946
Is that so?

567
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,490
I mean...

568
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,825
you're perfect.

569
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,787
I mean, like, per... perfect
in your own way.

570
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,622
In your special... your own special way.

571
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,458
Relax, I was teasing.

572
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,754
I'm obviously perfect
and Dustin's obviously lying.

573
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,506
Come on, Don Juan.

574
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,842
- Where are you going?
- Home.

575
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,514
Well... guess it's just you and me, Byers.

576
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,392
Um... it's late.

577
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,268
Sorry.

578
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,813
Maybe tomorrow we can play D&D.

579
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,023
Or something fun. Like we used to?

580
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,066
Yeah, sure.

581
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:51,985
Welcome home.

582
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,827
Yeah.

583
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,287
Welcome home.

584
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,584
Shit.

585
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,918
Shit.

586
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,131
Suzie? Suzie, is that you?

587
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,101
The silver cat feeds...

588
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,146
when blue meets yellow in the west...

589
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:33,736
A trip to China sounds nice...
If you tread lightly...

590
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,904
The week is long...

591
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,240
The silver cat feeds...

592
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,050
Beautiful,

593
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,094

Hey, Karen.

609
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,071
You don't mind if I call you Karen,
do you?

610
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,614
Good.

611
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,253
Oh, no.

612
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,047
No. Piece of shit.

613
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,884
Shit.

614
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,927
Damn it!

615
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,730
Ah, shit.

616
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,441
Damn it!

617
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,195
Piece of shit!

618
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,419
What the hell?

619
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,510
Who's there?

620
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,096
Hey!

621
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,892
I said, who's there?
